# LCEL Tutorial

## Welcome to the LCEL Tutorial Repository

This repository is structured to guide learners through both theoretical concepts and practical exercises on LangChain Expression Language (LCEL), enabling the construction of complex, stateful LLM applications.

## Repository Structure

- **/exercises**: Contains Python files with coding exercises to practice LCEL in real-world scenarios.
- **/theory**: Contains Markdown (.md) files with detailed tutorials and theoretical explanations to deepen your understanding of LCEL concepts.

## Tutorial List

1. **Introduction to LCEL**: Understand the core concepts and advantages of using LCEL for building multi-actor applications.
2. **Setting Up Your Environment**: Step-by-step guide to prepare your development environment for LCEL coding.
3. **Basic Chain Construction**: Learn how to create simple chains combining prompts, models, and output parsers.
4. **Advanced Chain Techniques**: Dive into more complex examples, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chains for context-aware responses.
5. **Utilizing Streaming and Parallelism**: Explore LCEL's built-in support for streaming data and executing parallel operations.
6. **Debugging and Logging**: Tips and tricks for debugging your chains and effectively logging their operations.
7. **Real-World Applications**: Examples and case studies on applying LCEL to solve practical problems.
