## LCEL Tutorial

Welcome to the **LCEL Tutorial** repository! This space is dedicated to practicing and mastering the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL), a powerful tool for building stateful, multi-actor applications with large language models (LLMs).

## Overview

LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) enables the creation of complex workflows involving multiple LLM actors. By learning LCEL, you'll be able to construct applications that leverage the full potential of LLMs for tasks ranging from simple data retrieval to sophisticated agent-like behaviors.

## Getting Started

Before diving into LCEL, ensure you have a basic understanding of LangChain and the concepts behind stateful LLM applications. This tutorial assumes familiarity with Python, as LangChain and LCEL are often used within Python environments.
